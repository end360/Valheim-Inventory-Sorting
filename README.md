# Valheim Inventory Sorting
This BepInEx plugin adds inventory sorting buttons to Valheim. The player inventory is sorted excluding the hotbar, containers are sorted entirely. 

Warning: There are windows-specific post-build events to create a zip file for uploading to https://valheim.thunderstore.io/ in the Visual Studio project.
